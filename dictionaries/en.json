      "description-p5": "The calculator assumes no additional pressure during fermentation, so if you ferment under higher pressure result will be most likely too high. It does not account for CO\u2082 loss to the headspace in standard fermenter and during packaging, which may result in a slightly underestimated result.",

It is necessary to make corrections for the sample after fermentation. The equation used in the calculator is based on empirical measurements made by a beer blogger (SeanTerrill).",
      "description-p2": "Temperature affects the refractometer reading, so the wort sample should be cooled before measurement.",
      "description-p3": "The correction factor is different for each device and should be determined independently: the result obtained from the refractometer reading (for unfermented wort) should be divided by the actual extract content (e.g., measured by a hydrometer) several times over the course of different batches and then averaged. Some calculators assume a default factor of 1.04, but there are no logical grounds for this until it is determined independently. It is probably better to assume a value of 1.00, as the device's factor could just as easily be below 1.",
      "description-p4": "In the context of homebrewing, Brix and Plato units are essentially identical. For differentiation and clarity, \u00B0Brix is arbitrary here and refers to the direct reading on the refractometer, not the actual value (not taking correction factor into account)."

      "description-p3": "You should specify the volume you anticipate at the end of brewing (it is assumed that standard wort evaporation is ~10% per hour, but it depends on various factors, e.g., surface area of the liquid sheet or intensity of boiling)."
